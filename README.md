SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION TASK (SUPERVISED LEARNING)
PROBLEM STATEMENT:-
In this regression task:
we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon on the number of hours they studied.
APPROACH:-
We use some supervised learning techiques to train various predictive models to get optimised output.
SUMMERY:-
-SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION
-LINEAR REGRESSION
